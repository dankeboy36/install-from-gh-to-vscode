Lib for VS Code extensions installing executables from GitHub

VS Code extensions can use it to get an executable from a GitHub release. This lib is the generalized way of getting the [`clangd`](https://clangd.llvm.org/) executable to the [`clang/vscode-clangd`](https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd) to VS Code at runtime.

Forked from [clangd/node-clangd@`2109d30`](https://github.com/clangd/node-clangd/commit/2109d30e9f05ea9059ce28d7218ec464deef8ea8) with the following changes for VS Code:
